Dot products are the core of matrix multiplication, which is an increasingly important operation in tasks such as computer graphics and artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is worthwhile to create a machine which can calculate dot products efficiently and quickly.

This repo aims to create a parameterizable dot product calculator in Verilog, using modules which are thoroughly tested.

A few building blocks are essential to create first:
- [ ] Adder
- [ ] Multiplier
