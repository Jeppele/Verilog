Purpose:
- This module increments up to a certain number and sets a signal high once that number is reached before resetting.

Ports:
- parameters:
    - N: The number which the counter counts up to.
- inputs:
    - clk (width 1): The system clock.
    - enable (width 1): The counter is only allowed to increment when this signal is high.
    - reset (width 1): Active high asynchronous reset. All outputs reset to 0.
- outputs:
    - out (width ceil(log_2(N))): The number the counter is up to.
    - done (width 1): Asserted whenever the counter is equal to N.

Verification tests:
- When module is reset, `out` and `done` are both set to 0.
- `out` only increments when enable is equal to 1.
- `done` is only set when `out` is equal to `N`.
- `out` wraps back to 1 on next increment after being equal to `N`.
